Throughout the year the company opened up offices in Singapore and America with plans to expand into China which meant the website and internal system had to account for multiple currencies and languages. During this time we shifted all of our digital assets to Akamai CDN; built an Ad Campaign bot to handle ads and modify ad spend depending on the companies sales; built a bot to scrape product prices to pipe into our internal system to allow Sales to concentrate on their clients; finally, pull all statistical data from the database and into Google BigQuery, ready to be used by Sale Directors and the CEO to monitor growth of the company.",
